STAA 551 - Case Study
Due Friday, October 11, 11:30pm 
Students will be divided into groups of 3 (subject to the class size being divisible by 3). Data will be provided to each group, along with a brief description of the data. Each group will submit one final Case Study paper containing all of the components listed below. The written portion should be 7 pages (or less), written in the same style as a journal article, but with more detail and focus on the analysis. Each student will also independently provide, by email, a peer evaluation of their group members.
